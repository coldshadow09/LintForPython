-|Lint.py|-
This program aims to check the programming style errors made in an input
Python file. Two Comma Separated Values (CSV) files; (1) an error file
and (2) a quality score file are created as a result from using this program.
(1) Error file: Summary of the errors made.
(2) Quality score log file: Log of the quality score of the code.

The type of errors detected in this program includes:
(1) Single character variables
(2) Long lines
(3) Trailing whitespaces in a line
(4) Bad indentation

-|Report.py|-
This program reports the last styling errors made by using the lint.py.
The program assumes that two Comma Separated Values (CSV) files generated by
lint.py already exist and can be read directly from them. The information
from the CSV files are then used to generate: (1) a Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG) file and (2) a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report file.

(1) SVG file: A quality score graph containing the historical quality score
data from an existing '<prefix>.score.csv' file.
(2) HTML report file: A webpage containing a numbered list of styling errors
made and a quality score graph image from the data in an existing
'<prefix>.lint.csv' file.
